## Overview

<p align="center">
<b>Supala</b> is a <b>permissionless cross-chain lending protocol</b> powered by <b>LayerZero</b>, purpose-built for <b>Real World Assets (RWA)</b> — starting with <b>tokenized stocks</b> on the <b>Mantle ecosystem</b>.
</p>

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Collateral</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Cross-Chain</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Tradeable</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">AAPL, AMZN, MSFT</td>
<td align="center">Borrow anywhere</td>
<td align="center">Without closing debt</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

Supala enables users to collateralize tokenized equities such as **AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT**, borrow against them across chains, and **actively trade their collateral without closing their lending position**.

> 💡 **Key Insight**  
> Supala introduces **Tradeable Collateral**, transforming lending positions from static vaults into **dynamic, actively managed portfolios**.

By combining Mantle’s **RWA-first ecosystem** with LayerZero’s **omnichain messaging**, Supala turns tokenized stocks into **fully composable cross-chain financial building blocks**.

## Why Mantle Is Supala’s Home Chain

<div style="border-left:4px solid #7c3aed;padding-left:12px">

### Built Where RWAs Already Live
Mantle has emerged as a natural settlement layer for RWAs and yield-bearing assets. Supala integrates directly with this ecosystem, making tokenized stocks **first-class on-chain collateral**.

### Designed for Active Collateral Management
Tradeable collateral requires **low latency, frequent updates, and minimal gas costs**. Mantle’s modular architecture enables this without sacrificing UX or capital efficiency.

### Secure Settlement for Real-Value Assets
Tokenized equities represent real economic value. Mantle’s Ethereum-backed security and fast finality provide the assurances required for RWA-scale lending.

## What Supala Unlocks for the Mantle Ecosystem

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>With Supala</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passive RWAs</td>
<td><b>Productive Capital</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Static Collateral</td>
<td><b>Trade While Borrowing</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Isolated Liquidity</td>
<td><b>Omnichain Liquidity Hub</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

### From Passive RWAs to Productive Capital
Supala enables borrowing, leverage, and portfolio optimization **without liquidating long-term equity exposure**.

### A New Lending Primitive
Trade your collateral **while keeping your debt open**, unlocking a new DeFi design space beyond traditional overcollateralized lending.

### Omnichain Liquidity, Mantle Settlement
LayerZero aggregates users and liquidity from multiple chains while Mantle remains the **risk and settlement engine**.

### Institutional-Ready Foundations
Predictable RWAs, flexible risk management, and permissionless design create a base layer for **institutional DeFi on Mantle**.

## Problem

<ul>
<li><b>Fragmented RWA Liquidity</b> across chains</li>
<li><b>No native cross-chain borrowing</b> against a single collateral position</li>
<li><b>Static collateral</b> once deposited</li>
<li><b>Tokenized stocks remain passive</b> on-chain</li>
</ul>

---

## Solution

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Unified Omnichain Borrowing</b></td>
<td>Borrow cross-chain while collateral stays on Mantle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>No Liquidity Fragmentation</b></td>
<td>Single risk engine, no manual bridging</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Tradeable Collateral</b></td>
<td>Rebalance without closing debt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Productive RWAs</b></td>
<td>Composable, active, cross-chain</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

## Features

### Tokenized Stocks as Collateral
Deposit **AAPL, MSFT, AMZN** and unlock liquidity without selling equity exposure.

### Cross-Chain Borrowing
Borrow assets on other chains while collateral remains secured on Mantle.

### Tradeable Collateral
Trade, rotate, and rebalance collateral **while your loan stays open**.

## Supala’s Role in Advancing the Mantle Ecosystem

### Expanding Mantle’s RWA Utility
Supala transforms tokenized stocks on Mantle from passive representations into productive, on-chain collateral. By enabling borrowing, leverage, and active collateral management, Supala increases real economic activity and capital efficiency for RWAs within the Mantle ecosystem.

### Establishing Mantle as the Omnichain RWA Hub
By anchoring collateral custody and risk management on Mantle while enabling cross-chain borrowing through LayerZero, Supala positions Mantle as the central settlement and coordination layer for omnichain RWA liquidity.

### Introducing a New DeFi Lending Primitive
Supala’s tradeable collateral model unlocks a new DeFi design space on Mantle, where lending, borrowing, and active portfolio management coexist within a single protocol. This expands Mantle’s DeFi capabilities beyond traditional overcollateralized lending systems.

### Driving Liquidity and User Growth
Supala attracts cross-chain users, RWA holders, and advanced DeFi participants into the Mantle ecosystem. This drives higher total value locked (TVL), increased transaction activity, and stronger long-term ecosystem stickiness.

### Laying the Foundation for Institutional DeFi
With permissionless access, predictable collateral behavior, and real-world-backed assets, Supala provides core infrastructure capable of supporting future institutional-grade DeFi products on Mantle.
